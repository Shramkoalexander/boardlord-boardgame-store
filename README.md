### Project Website:

- JavaScript
- React / Redux, Reselect, Saga
- Firebase
- Bootstrap (for layout)
- Git

### Project Overview:
This project serves as a simplified online store for board games and is built as a Single Page Application (SPA). It features basic search functionality with debounce, filtering, pagination, and product sorting. The website also includes a shopping cart and allows users to add items to their favorites list. User authentication and authorization are implemented.

### Skills Demonstrated:

- **Proficiency in React:** Utilization of React Hooks, custom hooks, and Higher-Order Components (HOCs).

- **State Management:** Use of Redux for state management, optimized with the Reselect library.

- **Asynchronous Operations:** Employed Redux-Saga for handling asynchronous requests, including Google authentication and database calls, facilitating real-time interaction with the database.

- **Database & Authorization:** Firebase Firestore serves as the database to store user data, cart contents, favorite items, and the general product catalog.
Implemented Firestore security rules to ensure that users can only access their own data and must be registered on the site to do so.

- **Enhanced User Experience:** For unregistered users, the shopping list and favorites are stored in the browser to prevent data loss in case the session is interrupted.

- **Styling & Layout:** Used CSS modules and SCSS for styling, and React Transition Group for component animations.
Utilized Bootstrap's grid system for website layout.

- **Deployment:** The website was deployed using Firebase hosting.
